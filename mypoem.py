(verse 1) Whose girl is that? I think I know.
Its owner is quite happy though.
Full of joy like a vivid rainbow,
I watch him laugh. I cry hello.

(verse 2) He gives his girl a shake,
And laughs until her belly aches.
The only other sound's the break,
Of distant waves and birds awake.

(chours) The girl is awesome, enjoyable and deep,
But he has promises to keep,
After cake and lots of sleep.
Sweet dreams come to him cheap.
